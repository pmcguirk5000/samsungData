The Samsung Data (UCI HAR Dataset) needs to be in your local directory.

run_analysis.R will combine the data from the following files:
X_train.txt and X_test.txt
y_train.txt and y_test.txt
subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt

It will then extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

It then gives descriptive names to the activities and subject and applies these to the data set.

Finally it creates a tiday data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
